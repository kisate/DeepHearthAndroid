    <string name="text_intro">From everlasting alliance of humans, elves and dwarves fought against dark creatures, who tried to destroy life everywhere they could see it. For a long time those monsters filled earth and nothing could stop them. One time a very powerful mage clan sacrificed itself to destroy evil. That clan almost succeeded, but liches, dukes of the undead, managed to bring their life sources underground and they survived. They built endless dungeons to hide there and gain their strength. After that emperor of the humanity made guilds all over alliance, which recruited adventurers to enter dungeons and destroy rest of the undead.\n\n You and your team were adventurers like them. Today you have entered another dungeon to obtain its treasures and destroy evil that hides there.</string>
